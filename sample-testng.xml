Parallel Execution of Classes in TestNG:
TestNG has run all the test cases (test methods) in the same class 
in the same thread but each Java class has run in different threads.
Parallel by classes, each class runs in its own thread, but within a class, 
the test methods are executed sequentially in a single thread.

<!--
Parallel Execution of Tests in TestNG:
TestNG has run all the test methods in the same <test> tag in the same thread but each <test> tag has run in different threads.
When you use parallel="tests" in the testng.xml file, each <test> tag runs in a separate thread, and all the test methods within a single <test> tag will run sequentially in the same thread.
